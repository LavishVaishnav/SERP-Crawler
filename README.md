# SERP-Crawler
This project involves building a SERP crawler specifically tailored for YouTube. Using Python and appropriate libraries, I have developed a program that retrieves data from YouTube search result pages.
By leveraging Python's web scraping capabilities, I have implemented techniques to handle page parsing, element extraction, and data extraction from the HTML structure of YouTube search result pages.

Crawler interacts with YouTube's server, sending HTTP requests to retrieve the search results, and then applies parsing techniques to extract the desired information from the received HTML content.

And finally save it to JSON and CSV files.
